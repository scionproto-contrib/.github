SCION is an inter-domain routing architecture. The core implementation lives in the [scionproto](https://github.com/scionproto) github organisation, specifically in the [scionproto/scion](https://github.com/scionproto/scion) repository.

This **scionproto-contrib** organisation is a place for various projects in the SCION ecosystem that aren't part of the SCION core implementation.
If you want to add your project here, get in touch in the chat, via email info@scion.org.

* The projects are maintained individually by the respective project owners.
* We, the owners of the scionproto-contrib organisation, only help to administrate this space. The responsibility for the content of the repositories lies with the respective project owners.
* We can intervene when we think its necessary (e.g. when a repository has been compromised or abandoned).
